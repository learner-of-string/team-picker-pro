# 🏏✨ Team Picker Pro

> _Your dream team. Your rules. Unlimited balance. Zero regrets._

Team Picker Pro is a clean, crisp, and slightly chaotic React web app that lets users build their own fantasy cricket squad. Whether you're a sports geek or a total noob (hi 👋), this project makes team-building feel like online shopping — but instead of clothes, you're hoarding cricketers.

  Choose your team with just a few clicks — from legends to "Who is that?" type players.

- 🔄 **Dynamic Toastify Alerts**  
  Everything you do (buy, reject, flex) gets real-time feedback by `SONNER`— so you feel like a boss.
